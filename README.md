YearUp Capstone 1: Build an e-commerce website
## Description
My first capstone is a nonfunctional mockup of an e-commerce website where I am showcasing my culinary prowess and selling different dishes that I have made in the past. I made an effort to select a wide array of dishes to showcase my range of experience. This project was enjoyable for me because I hope to someday soon convert it to a fully functional website that includes a variety of catering services as well, so people can use it to contract me as a private chef. I did the bulk of my work using VS code and familiarized myself with how to navigate this platform. I relied heavily on Bootstrap and w3schools as resources, and feel much more comfortable using them than I did a week ago.
