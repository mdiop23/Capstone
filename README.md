# Capstone
YearUp Capstone 1: Build an e-commerce website
## Description
My first capstone is a nonfunctional mockup of an e-commerce website where I am showcasing my culinary prowess and selling different dishes that I have made in the past. I made an effort to select a wide array of dishes to showcase my range of experience. This project was enjoyable for me because I hope to someday soon convert it to a fully functional website that includes a variety of catering services as well, so people can use it to contract me as a private chef. I did the bulk of my work using VS code and familiarized myself with how to navigate this platform. I relied heavily on Bootstrap and w3schools as resources, and feel much more comfortable using them than I did a week ago.

## Notes

An interesting piece of code that I wrote was on my products page, in each individual card where I was able to link each product to the checkout page so it appeared to add them to the cart.
I think it is such a cool aspect and the one piece of my site that gives the appearance of true functionality.


    <div class="card-body">
                    <a href="checkout.html" class="card-link">Add to cart</a>
                </div>
